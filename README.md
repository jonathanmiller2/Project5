# Project5

My problem solving approach involved finishing single parts of the GUI one part at a time. I set up the GUI from top left down, then I added the logic, helper methods, and event handling. This project was mostly boilerplate code, and I'm aware that a lot of my code violates DRY. I'm also aware that a lot of this could be encapsulated better. However, I only realized that at the end of the project, and reworking the code would take a lot of effort to solve a non-issue. 

There wasn't much in the way of problem-solving techniques. Most of my process involves just looking online and at my past code and figuring out syntaxes. The logical part of the code is relatively simple, and very natural to me.
